## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Use the app's basic CRUD operations & enjoy a good user experience through its other features like sound effects, two light modes & the support of two languages.

### Links

- Live Site URL: [https://smart-todo.netlify.app/](https://smart-todo.netlify.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript
- HTML Web Storage API (localStorage Object)

### Notes

- All colors custom properties in the style sheet or icon names in the images/icons folder don't match its true name of color but reverse that matches the screen light mode being used.
- Specifying a background image to the body tag causes a jumping issue while scrolling the page through mobile devices, so I used background color instead.
